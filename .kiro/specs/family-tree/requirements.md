# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Family Tree application is a digital genealogy tool that allows users to create, visualize, and manage family relationships. The application provides an intuitive interface for building family trees by adding root parents and their children, with detailed profile information for each family member. The system emphasizes clear visual representation of parent-child relationships and easy access to detailed member information.

4. IF no family tree exists THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to add root parents first

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add children to existing family members, so that I can expand the family tree with new generations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a family member THEN the system SHALL provide an option to add children
2. WHEN the user adds a child THEN the system SHALL create a parent-child relationship link
3. WHEN a child is added THEN the system SHALL visually connect the child to their parent(s)
4. IF a family member already has children THEN the system SHALL display all existing children when adding new ones

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view detailed information about any family member, so that I can access their complete profile.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks on a family member THEN the system SHALL display a detailed view with full information
2. WHEN the detailed view opens THEN the system SHALL show Full Name, email, Date of Birth, and other profile details
3. WHEN viewing details THEN the system SHALL provide options to edit the information
4. IF required fields are missing THEN the system SHALL highlight incomplete profiles

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to clearly distinguish between parents and children in the family tree visualization, so that I can easily understand family relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the family tree is displayed THEN the system SHALL use visual indicators to show parent-child relationships
2. WHEN displaying family members THEN the system SHALL position children below their parents
3. WHEN showing connections THEN the system SHALL use clear lines or connectors between related members
4. IF multiple generations exist THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent visual hierarchy

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate through the family tree easily, so that I can explore different branches and generations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the family tree becomes large THEN the system SHALL provide zoom and pan functionality
2. WHEN the user hovers over a family member THEN the system SHALL highlight their immediate relationships
3. WHEN navigating the tree THEN the system SHALL maintain visual clarity of relationships
4. IF the tree extends beyond the viewport THEN the system SHALL provide scrolling or navigation controls

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to edit family member information, so that I can keep profiles up to date and accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses a family member's details THEN the system SHALL provide edit functionality
2. WHEN editing information THEN the system SHALL validate required fields before saving
3. WHEN changes are saved THEN the system SHALL update the display immediately
4. IF invalid data is entered THEN the system SHALL show appropriate error messages

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to delete family members when necessary, so that I can correct mistakes or remove incorrect entries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user requests to delete a family member THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation dialog
2. WHEN a family member is deleted THEN the system SHALL handle relationship updates appropriately
3. WHEN deleting a parent with children THEN the system SHALL ask how to handle the orphaned children
4. IF the deletion would break the tree structure THEN the system SHALL provide options to maintain integrity
